Project Title: Deep Learning model to estimate near-surface air temperature in Israel
Advisor: Dr. Oren Glickman (CS, BIU). 


The goal of this project is to build a deep-learning model to estimate near-surface air temperature in Israel at a 1x1 km resolution. Based on satellite information we have estimates of air temperature (2m above ground) at a 9x9 km resolution. However, the granularity is very coarse and actual temperatures may vary widely.  We do have lots of information that we can use to better estimate the air temperature at a 1x1 granularity - 
Topography (hight of the ground)
Land Surface Temperatures (LST) - at a 1x1 resolution 
Vegetation index from satellite imaging - at a 1x1 resolution
Other information such as wind, radiation, time of day etc. 
Training and evaluation is done by measuring RMSE over actual air temperature data measures at various meteorological stations scattered across israel. 


An MA from The Department of Geography and Environment at Bar Ilan University is already working on the project, has collected the data and has run some initial models. Your goal will be to test improvements to these model by implementation and testing various deep learning models.
